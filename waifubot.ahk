;You can increase this number to get more reliable results because the ping of waifubot varies
;The minimum cooldown accounting for no lag is around 3.4 seconds

#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.

SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
