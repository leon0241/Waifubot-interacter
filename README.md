# Waifubot-interacter
Scripts to interact with the discord bot WaifuBot

##Why would you want this?
Waifubot has an annoying cooldown timer, and it's a lot of hassle spending 20 minutes of your time spamming a chat with interactions

##Installing
There are 2 files included, the autohotkey file, and the compiled exe file. Just double click to run. You'll see it running in your taskbar if you did it correctly.
If you want the script to run on startup,
- create a shortcut to your script
- type %appdata% into your file managers path bar.
- navigate to Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
- put your shortcut in there

##How to use
There are 2 scripts in the file, one to interact with all your waifus going down a list, and one where you pick the waifus you want interacted with.
For the first script, press ctrl+f1 to run the script, and type the highest id in your list into the message box. It will cycle through them one by one.
For the second script, press ctrl+f2 to run, and type each waifu you want interacted with one by one into the message box. When you've entered them all, press cancel and it will cycle through your inputted list.
If you ever want to cancel the script halfway through, *hold* f4 until the message box appears saying it's cancelled.
